            <strong>First World War</strong> <br />
            The Indian Army Military Nursing Service has its origin in the Army
            Nursing Service formed in 1888 as part of the British Army. The
            force went through many changes in its years of existence. In 1893,
            it was designated as Indian Army Nursing Service. The force went
            through further changes in 1902, when the Indian Nursing Service and
            the Army Nursing Service were combined and on 27 March 1902, it was
            redesignated to Queen Alexandra's Imperial Military Nursing
            Service.[2] At the outbreak of the World War in 1914 there were just
            fewer than 300 nurses in the QAIMNS, by the end of the war this had
            raised to 10,404. The Army nurses served in Flanders, the
            Mediterranean, the Balkans, the Middle East and onboard hospital
            ships. Of the 200 plus army nurses died on active service, many were
            Indians. After, the war on 1 October 1926, the Nursing Services was
            made a permanent part of British Indian Army. This date is now being
            celebrated as the Corps day of Military Nursing Service, though in
            actual its origins occurred 45 five years before (many Corps of the
            Army) the Army Medical Corps also traces its origin to more than
            hundreds of years back in the similar way, though it was constituted
            in the present form in 1948
          </p>
          <p class="card-text fs-6 fw-normal">
            <strong>Second World War</strong> <br />
            With the outbreak of the Second world war, nurses once again found
            themselves serving all over the world, including Singapore, Burma,
            Italy, Mesopotamia, Ceylon, Egypt and Western Africa. The changing
            working conditions and wartime shortages led to changes in uniform.
            Khaki slacks and battledress blouses replaced the grey and scarlet
            ward dress and rank insignia was adopted to signify the officer
            status of the nurses. In the Far East, the fall of Hong Kong and
            Singapore led to many army nurses (including Indian) being captured
            by the Japanese and endured terrible hardships and deprivations of
            the Far East prisoner-of-war camps. During the middle of the war in
            1943, the Indian arm of the Nursing Services was separated through
            Indian Military Nursing Service Ordinance, 1943 and redesignated,
            thereby constituting the Indian Military Nursing Service (IMNS). The
            IMNS was an auxiliary subject to the provisions of the Indian Army
            Act, 1911. However they were of commissioned officers ranking
            equally with Indian commissioned officers. This was the first time
            in the history of the Indian Army women were granted commissioned
            officer ranks.

          <p class="card-text fs-6 fw-normal">
            <strong>Post Independence</strong> <br />
            After the independence in 1950, the Government of India constituted
            the Military Nursing Service (MNS) by issuing Army Instruction
            274/50, to set the terms and conditions of service for the grant of
            regular commissions in the MNS forming part of the regular Army,
            subject to the Army Act, 1950. The IMNS stood subsumed in the MNS as
            on 12 August 1950, and the auxiliary force called IMNS formally
            cease to exist. The MNS was constituted as an all women, all officer
            Corps of the Indian Army, and it remains so.[8] On 23 November 1954
            the Central Government made the Army Rules, 1954 and brought MNS
            under the Army Rules along with every other Corps/ Service of the
            regular Army. Subsequently, on 3 January 1959, through Army
            Instruction 4/59, the Government of India re-designated the rank of
            the officers in the MNS to conform to the nomenclature used by the
            other officers of the regular Army. After having re-designated the
            rank in the MNS by the Government, the Chief of Army Staff (COAS)
            through Army Order 501/63 laid down that the MNS Officers are
            required to salute and are entitled to salutes in the manner as
            other Commissioned Officers of the Army. The COAS further issued
            Army Order 120/73; and laid down the order of precedence of the
            Arms/ Services and Units of the Army including the MNS. On 15 March
            1982 the COAS had cancelled the earlier Army Order 120/73 and issued
            Army Order 11/82 laid down the order of precedence of the Arms/
            Services and Units of the Army including the MNS and the on the
            subject with some further additions of newly raised Corps, which is
            valid even today.[9]
